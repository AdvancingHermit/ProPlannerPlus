# ProPlannerPlus
This project was written in java 17.
The program is run in the App class in src/main/java/controllers/App
Upon start of the App, there are three registered employee: "bob" "tim" and "hbb", which can be used to login. Alternatively "admin" can also be used, but is restricted to only being able to add/remove employees, using an employee is thus required to access the whole program.
